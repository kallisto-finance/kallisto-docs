# Introduction

Using the Kallisto Curve APY chaser vault, a liquidity provider is able to maximize 
their yield generation and risk management on Curve Finance. Kallisto’s Curve APY chaser 
vault is a DeFi asset management tool that automatically provides and deploys dynamic liquidity 
provider strategies for Curve pool. Kallisto monitors the overall pool statistics on Curve's DEX 
and searches for the best liquidity provider opportunities.

Kallisto v1 was previously built on Terra, which is no longer functioning. Kallisto is moving 
to Ethereum to launch a new vault. This new vault will aim to provide a low-cost, data science-based 
strategy for liquidity providers to participate in Curve pools. By aggregating users’ deposits and 
monitoring price dynamics, the vault can significantly reduce the cost for staying in the highest 
APY pools on Curve.

The vault screens for large, balanced pools as candidates and selects the pool with the highest APY 
with both base and CRV returns aggregated. By consistently moving liquidity into the optimal pool, the 
vault is designed to achieve the best return across all Curve pools while keeping liquidity risk low. 

::: danger Use at your own risk

Volume Finance does not formally endorse any pools, strategies, or vaults. Vaults may be compromised
and are subject to things like unexpected volatility, high token inflation, and algorithmic flaws. Users 
are responsbile for their own funds as Kallisto is non-custodial. Kallisto is still in an alpha phase and 
strategies may break.
