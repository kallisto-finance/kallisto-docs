# Introduction

Liquidity providers are often rewarded based on how much volume they control in a liquidity 
pool. Using Kallisto, a liquidity provider is able to automate their yield generation and risk 
management.

Kallisto is an automated yield maximizer that targets decentralized exchange liquidity pools to 
maximize yield for liquidity providers. Kallisto dynamically chases the best APY by using a DeFi 
asset management protocol, a Curve-based APY chaser vault, to provide dynamic liquidity.

Kallisto v1 was previously built on Terra, which is no longer functioning. Kallisto is moving to 
Ethereum to launch a new vault. This new vault will aim to provide a low-cost, data science-based 
strategy for liquidity providers to participate in Curve pools. By aggregating usersâ€™ deposits and 
monitoring price dynamics, the vault can significantly reduce the cost for staying in the highest 
APY pools on Curve.
