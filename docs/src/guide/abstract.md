# Abstract

AMMs (Automated Market Makers) facilitate the permissionless trade of assets 
through various liquidity pools. AMMs are undoubtedly a core pillar of DeFi
(decentralized finance). In 2021, Curve Finance, had around 69.7 billion dollars 
of volume across their DEX (decentralized exchange). To create and maintain liqudity, 
LPs (liquidity providers) contribute to the volume of assets in a liquidity pool and 
are often incentived based on the amount of volume they control. However, an LP is 
often faced with the challenges of searching for the best yield opportunities for their 
liqudity, strategies that sustain reasonable risk-to-reward and cost-to-reward ratios, 
and overall asset management, which is often addressed by using a vault. A vault is an 
automated strategy to maximize the yield of deposited assets. In these docs, we describe 
Kallisto Finance, a solution to maximize yield, dynamically chase APY on Curve, and reimagine 
DeFi volume.
